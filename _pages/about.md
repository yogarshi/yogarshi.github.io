I am Yogarshi Vyas, and I currently work as an Applied Scientist in Amazon (AWS) AI in New York. My current work spans various aspects of information extraction, with a focus on noisy and challenging settings. Previously, I did my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland in the CLIP lab, where I was advised by [Marine Carpuat](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/). I wrote my thesis on semantic divergences across languages, drawing from threads in lexical semantics, machine translation, and multilingual NLP.
